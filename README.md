# CmcScriptNet.WPF---master
Portable Commence Item Detail Form Script Editor

Requirements: .Net Framework 4.5 (Commence RM 6.x and higher will install it if not present, it is an OS component as of Windows 8)

CmcScriptNet.WPF is modeled after ScriptPad, the best Commence script editor ever. Thank you, Mathias!

CmcScriptNet.WPF borrows heavily from Scintilla.Net and Scintilla.WPF.
