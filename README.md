# CmcScriptNet.WPF
Standalone Commence Item Detail Form Script Editor.

No installation required, it should run *as-is* on any system with .Net Framework 4.8 or higher installed. That requires at minimum Windows 10 system with the 10 May 2019 Update. I do not remember why the bump to 4.8 was necessary, previous versions used 4.5 which would greatly improve availability on systems prior to 2019.

CmcScriptNet.WPF is modeled after <b>ScriptPad</b> (no longer available), the best Commence script editor ever. Thank you, Mathias!

CmcScriptNet.WPF relies heavily on <a href="https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET">ScintillaNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET.WPF">ScintillaNet.WPF</a>.

All I did was add some Commence scripting stuff to it. As WPF goes, it is *not* a well-designed application, nor was that even a design consideration. I just wanted an editor that requires no installation.
