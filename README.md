# CmcScriptNet.WPF
Standalone Commence Item Detail Form Script Editor.

No installation required, it should run on any system with .Net Framework 4.5 installed.

Commence RM 6.x and higher will install it if not present, and it is a native OS component since Windows 8. Unless you have a very old Win7 system, you should be able to run this.

CmcScriptNet.WPF is modeled after <a href="http://users.telenet.be/thiam/scriptpad.htm">ScriptPad</a>, the best Commence script editor ever. Thank you, Mathias!

CmcScriptNet.WPF borrows heavily from <a href="https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET">ScintillaNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET.WPF">ScintillaNet.WPF</a>.
