# CmcScriptNet.WPF
Standalone Commence Item Detail Form Script Editor.

No installation required, it should run *as-is* on any system with .Net Framework 4.5 installed.

.Net Framework 4.5 is a native OS component since Windows 8. Unless you have a very old Win7 system, you should be able to run this without issue. Notice that as of Commence 6.0 (now obsolete), .Net Framework 4.5 will be installed as part of the installation.

CmcScriptNet.WPF is modeled after <a href="http://users.telenet.be/thiam/scriptpad.htm">ScriptPad</a>, the best Commence script editor ever. Thank you, Mathias!

CmcScriptNet.WPF relies heavily on <a href="https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET">ScintillaNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET.WPF">ScintillaNet.WPF</a>.

All I did was add some Commence scripting stuff to it. As WPF goes, it is *not* a well-designed application, nor was that even a design consideration. I just wanted an editor that requires no installation.
